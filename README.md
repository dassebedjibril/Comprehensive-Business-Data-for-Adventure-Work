## Project Workflow

The project was executed following a structured workflow, utilizing various data sets:





### Step 1: Data Connection and Preparation

#### Objective: 
Efficiently connect to and prepare the data for analysis.

#### Data Files:
- Calendar Lookup
- Customer Lookup
- Territory Lookup
- Product Categories Lookup
- Product Subcategories Lookup
- Product Lookup

#### Activities:
- Use Power Query for connecting to the above data sources.
- Apply data profiling tools to assess data quality and structure.
- Perform transformations to clean and structure data effectively.





### Step 2: Data Modeling

#### Objective: 
Build a robust data model to support complex analytical queries.

#### Activities:
Design relational data models emphasizing normalization and efficient filter flow.
Establish relationships with proper cardinality using lookup tables.
Create a star schema centered around Sales Data as fact tables.





### Step 3: DAX Calculations

#### Objective: 
Develop calculated columns and measures to provide in-depth and dynamic analysis capabilities.


#### Activities:
- #### Add Calculated Columns: 
Enhance the data model by adding calculated columns that support further analysis, such as Full Name *(Customer Detail)* for combining first and last names.



- #### Develop Measures for Real-Time Analytics:
#### Rolling Calculations: 
Compute rolling totals to capture trends over specific periods, such as `10-days Rolling Revenue` and `90-day Rolling Profit`.

#### Sales Analysis: 
Measures like `Bike Sales`, `Bulk Orders`, and `Total Orders (Customer Detail)` offer insights into different aspects of sales performance.

#### Customer Analytics: 
Track `Total Customers`, `Average Revenue per Customer`, and analyze specific metrics like `Total Orders (Customer Detail)`.

#### Profitability and Cost Measures: 
Determine financial health through `Total profit`, `Total Cost`, `Profit Target`, and `Profit Target Gap`.

#### Return Metrics: 
Analyze return rates and quantities with `Bike Return Rate`, `Quantity returned`, `Total returns`, and `Return Rate`.



- #### Implement Advanced DAX Formulas and Functions:

#### Target vs. Performance: 
Calculate gaps between targets and actuals with measures such as `Order Target Gap`, `Profit Target Gap`, and `Revenue Target Gap`.

#### Historical Comparisons: 
Utilize measures like `Previous Months Orders`, `Previous Months Profit`, `Previous Months Returns`, and `Previous Months Revenue` to compare current performance against historical data.

#### Year-To-Date and Aggregate Measures: 
Analyze year-to-date performance with `YTD Revenue` and aggregate order details with `All Orders`, `Total Orders`.





### Step 4: Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation

#### Objective: 
Design interactive visuals and dashboards that effectively simplify and convey complex data insights.

#### Activities:

- **Develop Comprehensive Visuals**:
#### Executive Dashboard: 

Assemble high-level KPIs and metrics in a consolidated view to offer executives a quick snapshot of overall business health.

#### Geographical Insights: 
Use the `Map` page to visualize data geographically, highlighting regional sales performance, customer distribution, and territory coverage.

#### Product and Customer Insights:
*`Product Details:`* Provide deep dives into product performance, inventory levels, and profitability by category and subcategory.

*`Customer Detail:`* Offer insights into customer behavior, segmentation, and value, enhancing targeted marketing strategies.


- **Advanced Analysis Tools**:
#### Q & A: 
Natural language querying enables users to ask questions directly and receive insights without traditional report navigation.

#### Decomposition Tree: 
Utilize this tool on the DÃ©composition Tree page to break down data dynamically, exploring different dimensions and discovering root causes of performance metrics.
#### Key Influencers: 
Analyze the Key influencers page to identify which factors most significantly impact KPIs, aiding in predictive analysis and strategic planning.



-  **Customize Visual Formats and Interactivity**:

#### Enhance User Experience: 
Tailor chart and visual formats to enhance readability and user engagement. Manage the interactions between report elements to create a coherent narrative across pages.

#### Dynamic Navigation: 
Employ filters and bookmarks to navigate through the data dynamically, enabling users to customize views and drill down into specific areas of interest.






### Step 5: Performance Optimization

#### Objective: 
Optimize the performance of Power BI reports and dashboards.

#### Activities:
Employ optimization techniques to enhance report responsiveness.
Optimize DAX queries and review report configurations for efficiency.




### Data Files Specifics

#### Annual Sales Data:
Sales Data 2020
Sales Data 2021
Sales Data 2022

#### Returns Data:
Analyzed to integrate customer satisfaction and product quality insights into the reports.


## Conclusion
This Power BI project demonstrates the detailed process of converting extensive raw data into meaningful insights that facilitate strategic decision-making within AdventureWorks. The dashboards serve as crucial tools for ongoing business assessment and strategy development.
